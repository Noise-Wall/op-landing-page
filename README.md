# Landing Page Project

This is a project assignment from The Odin Project's Foundations course. It wraps up the CSS part of the course, after the Flexbox lessons. It is a template landing page, with freedom to replace the content inside of it. Kept it template-only, though.

These projects, more than for learning the content itself, has been great for learning to use other useful technologies, in particular Obsidian, Bash and Vim/Neovim. It was great practice for CSS styling, though.
